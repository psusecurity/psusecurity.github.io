## Introduction

Welcome to the 2017 NSA Competition!

## Registration

To get started, register by sending email to <s2istnsa@gmail.com>. You could use one edu email account or student id as credential. Then, visit [the preparation part](#preparation) to receive your instructions for preparing virtual machine in the challenge.

For information on core dump and for some tips on how to get started, check out [References](#references) section.

Good luck!

### Deadline of registration

XX-XX-XXXX

## Preparation

At first, you need to install VirtualBox by following Documents :

- [Installation of VirtualBox in Windows/Mac](https://github.com/psusecurity/psusecurity.github.io/raw/master/doc/VirtualBox_Installation.pdf)
- [Installation of VirtualBox in Ubuntu](https://github.com/psusecurity/psusecurity.github.io/raw/master/doc/Install_VirtualBox_on_Ubuntu.pdf)

or Videos :

- [Install VirtualBox on Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63_kPIQUPp8)
- [Install VirtualBox on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEvM-No4eQo)
- [How to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si0nSaCnNoY).

Second, you need to download one virtual machine package from [PSU Box](), open it with you installed virtualbox. The username and password is **s2ist** and **s2ist**. All the files related with Challenges are in the `/home/s2ist/Challenges/`. Please read the README file before the next step.

Finally, you could execute instruction in Tip 1 to disable ASLR(Address Space Layout Randomization).

## Challenges

### Challenge 1 : Generate malicious input to print out "Welcome to overflow!"

Given vulnerable binary - challenge1, generate malicious input to get the specific output - "Welcome to overflow". In order to make life easier, we provide its source code.

Submission : a screenshot with commands to get specific output and md5 of binary you use.

### Challenge 2 : Generate malicious input to print out "Welcome to overflow!"

Given vulnerable binary - challenge2, generate malicious input to get the specific output - "Welcome to overflow". In order to make life easier, we provide its source code.

Submission : a screenshot with commands to get specific output and md5 of binary you use.

### Challenge 3 : Craft malicious input file and invoke gedit

Given vulnerable binary - challenge3, generate malicious input to get gedit window open. In order to make life easier, we provide its source code. And you could read Reference 2 to get some information about **buffer overflow**.

### Challenge 4 : Craft malicious input file and invoke one command in source code

Given vulnerable binary - challenge4, generate malicious input to get gedit window open. In order to make life easier, we provide its source code. And you could read Reference 3 to get some information about **interger overflow**.

### Challenge 5: Learn Coredump

Given one coredump, ask some questions related to coredump format.  You could read References 4, 5 and 6 to get all the following information.

1. Show the magic number for Coredump.
2. Show program header table.
3. Show the value of address 0x8048010(double word size) in the coredump?

### Challenge 6: Coredump with source code and binary (Non-corrupted coredump)
 
Given Coredump with binary and Source code, try to catch the root cause. You could read References 7, 8 to get stacktrace. And you could read Reference 9 to get value of variables.

### Challenge 7: Coredump with source code and binary (Corrupted coredump)

Given Coredump with binary and Source code, try to catch the root cause. You could read References 7, 8 to get stacktrace. And you could read Reference 9 to get value of variables.

<!---

### Challenge 8: Coredump with only binary (Corrupted coredump)

Given Coredump with binary and Source code, try to catch the root cause. You could read References 7, 8 to get stacktrace. And you could read Reference 9 to get value of variables.

## Tips

### Tip 1

Q : How to turn off ASLR?    
A : `echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`
